excerpt: 'Buckled surfaces induced by mismatched swelling and elastic properties of materials are commonly observed in nature, such as on cacti and euphorbias. We designed a 3D printed tubular structure, composed of soft swellable poly N-isopropylacrylamide (pNIPAM) segments and stiff non-swellable polyacrylamide (pAAM) segments. Similar to the shape change of Saguaro stems after rainfall, the tubes show tunable periodic buckling modes in water at the room temperature. '
