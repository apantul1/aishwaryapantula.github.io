excerpt: 'Crawling has been demonstrated previously with thermoresponsive hydrogels but required patterned or constrained gels or substrates to break symmetry for unidirectional motion. Here, we demonstrate a locomotion mechanism for unidirectionally crawling gels driven by spontaneous asymmetries in contact forces during swelling and deswelling of segmented active thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) and passive polyacrylamide (pAAM) bilayers with suspended linkers. Actuation studies demonstrate the consistent unidirectional movement of these gel crawlers across multiple thermal cycles on flat, unpatterned substrates. We explain the mechanism using finite element simulations and by varying experimental parameters such as the linker stiffness and the number of bilayer segments. We elucidate design criteria and validate experiments using image analysis and finite element models. We anticipate that this mechanism could potentially be applied to other shape-changing locomotors.'
